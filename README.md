# lampshades models

My lampshade on the Ikea lamp is similar to [HEKTOGRAM](https://www.ikea.com/cz/cs/p/hektogram-stojaci-cteci-lampa-stribrna-bila-80477710/) was broken. I thought about buying a new light, but I wouldn't say I like the latest version of the lamp, and I'm a happy owner of a 3D printer.

I have two versions of lampshades; both are made in amazing [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org) and are fully customizable.

The first model which I made is `lampshade_conical.scad`. That was the easier one. But I wanted to have the lampshade more curved, so I did the second model, `lampshade_curved.scad`.

Configuration of the `lampshade_conical` is pretty simple, and the second is more complex - you need to play with `curved_factor` to find a proper design and height.

And btw. I lost the nut for the lampshade. That is the reason why my models contain nuts. If you don't want nutâ€”comment `nut` line.

I wish you a lot of fun with modeling (and printing).
